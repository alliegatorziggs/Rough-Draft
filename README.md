# Rough-Draft
Many authors do not have an effective process for backing up their work. Often, authors will simply save many, many vaguely named Microsoft Word files with different versions of their work in a Dropbox or Google Drive. Over the course of a long project (such as a novel), it can become difficult to track and maintain the various versions of the story. This app will use git as a basis for a version control system for authors. All git commands will be obscured by an easy-to-learn user interface tailored for MS word files, giving authors the benefits of version control without ever opening a command line.
Phase 1:
Create a working backup system with a web app as the front end.
Using existing git commands behind the scenes, obscure away any need for the use of the command line for backups
Use language and formatting that is familiar to writers
Focus on commits and pushes for the first round -- basic functionality will be the ability to save and access multiple versions of the same project
Create a text representation of the .docx file so a version can be previewed from the web app.
Phase 2:
Expand the web app for more collaboration (allow for commenting and adding collaborators on a project)
Tailor certain git features, such as issues and branching, specifically for revision and critiquing
